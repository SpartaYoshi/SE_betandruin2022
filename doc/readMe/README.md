+**RemoveEvent()** use case: To implement this use case, we had to take into account that all references to the Event were declared as PERSIST.TYPE=ALL, that means that it will have a cascade effect both on removing and persisting events.
With this, we ensure that when an Event is removed, all its questions are also removed, and all the results of the question, and all the bets of the result...
Finally, the user's list of bets needed to be updated, so we had to do that "manually", checking which user had a bet related to the deleted event. If that's the case, the bet will have all it's attributes marked as null, so we just have to delete it.


+**ShowMovements()** use case: To implement this use case, we had to take into account that a new class is needed, in this case, we created a new class called Movement, in which we will have the date of the money movement, the description (deposit, place a bet, win a bet), and the amount of money the user gained or lost.
As we take the dates when the movement is done (current or instant date and hour), all the movements will be represented in a table ordered by the date, and, obviously, the current amount of money will be printed above, so as the user is able to see how much money does he/she has in that moment.


+ **Final Note**:
  To login as an administrator:[*username*: **"juanan"**, *password*: **"hello"**]
    + To login as a regular user: [*username*: **"ainhoa"**, *password*: **"123"**]
      Because of that, the remote database is as *initialize*. Once that user has been created, the mode can be changed to *open* again.
