+**RemoveEvent** use case: To implement this use case, we had to take into account that all references to the Event were declared as PERSIST.TYPE=ALL, that means that it will have a cascade effect both on removing and persisting events.
With this, we ensure that when an Event is removed, all its questions are also removed, and all the results of the question, and all the bets of the result...
Finally, the user's list of bets needed to be updated, so we had to do that "manually", checking which user had a bet related to the deleted event. If that's the case, the bet will have all it's attributes marked as null, so we just have to delete it.

+**MyProfile** use case: This use case has been created in order to display all the information of the current user. It allows also to navigate to other use cases, which are Show Movements, Edit Password, or Check My Results. 

+**EditPassword** use case: This application also gives the option to the user to modify his/her password. So this use case allows the user to do it. Only the password, since the application takes the name, surname, birthdate and username as permanent. The system shows an error message in two cases. First one, when the user writes the same password as he/she already had and, the second one, when the field is not filled. Once the password has been changed, we persist the user, so that the change is permanent.

+**CheckMyResults** use case:

+**ShowMovements** use case: To implement this use case, we had to take into account that a new class is needed, in this case, we created a new class called Movement, in which we will have the date of the money movement, the description (if the money is deposited, won or the user has placed a bet or cancelled one of them), and also the amount of money the user gained or lost.
As we take the dates when the movement is done (current or instant date and hour), all the movements will be represented in a table ordered by the date, and, obviously, the current amount of money will be printed above, so as the user is able to see how much money does he/she has in that moment and all the movements done.


+ **Final Note**:
    + To login as an administrator:[*username*: **"juanan"**, *password*: **"hello"**]
    + To login as a regular user: [*username*: **"ainhoa"**, *password*: **"123"**]
      Because of that, the remote database is as *initialize*. Once that user has been created, the mode can be changed to *open* again.
